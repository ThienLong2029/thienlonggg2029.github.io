                        <p>My course started on Tuesday, August 15. But due to some unforeseen circumstances, my first class as well as my classmates started on Thursday of the same week. The teacher in charge of teaching our class is Mr. Jonathan. When I entered the classroom I felt very comfortable and happy. The first friend I made in my Intro to Science and Technology class was Tin. The first thing I entered the class was to introduce myself and Mr.Jonathan told me to write my full name and student ID on the board, which surprised me quite a bit. The reason was that I was late to class, so I thought I would be reminded or deducted points for attendance. But it was all because I worried a little too much. After all, there was nothing; I think so. In this first class, Mr. Jonathan gave us a detailed introduction to the entire IT industry as well as the sub-disciplines taught at RMIT University's Saigon South branch. In that topic, I learned about the bachelor of IT and Engineering. Moreover, I also learned about IT training programs and program maps. All of that was done by Mr. Jonathan conveyed in the most specific way. We are fortunate that our instructor in charge of this subject is Mr. Jonathan. Nextly, we mentioned assignments in Canvas. After being introduced to the assignments that we would have to perform during the entire Intro to Science and Technology course, I quickly became friends with Tin, and then he and I worked together to discuss the contents of those assignments. There was a positive thing, I was very happy when Tin is a very sociable person and always active in learning, from the first lesson he was very happy to teach me things. I also had questions about assignments, and we contacted each other to facilitate assignments. It was a bit confusing for me, to be honest, during the introduction to the assignments I was a bit distracted. Then, most of the time I didn't understand the requirements of the assignments. But thanks to the help of Tin, my classmates, and teachers, I was able to solve that problem. Another disadvantage is that the type of computer that room 2.4.41 uses is an iMac, but I am a user of computers running the Windows operating system, so I had a bit of trouble about the iMac experience. Although, I've always wanted to try the iMac experience once. Although it was possible, this was also a bit difficult for me. In the end, what I have gained for myself in this first session is the general knowledge that will serve as the foundation for my future pursuit of information technology.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="subheading"><strong>#2 The next self-study experience .</strong></h2>
                        <p>Last week, I had a wonderful experience for the first session of Intro to Science and Technology. Unfortunately, I had a problem that no one expected to have and that was having Covid-19. Although I had 3 vaccinations, the common symptoms of the disease were still raging in my body and I had a fever for 5 days straight. This is also the main reason why I have to be absent throughout the 2 classes of this 2nd week. However, as soon as my body recovered from Covid-19 infection, there is still the possibility of infecting those around me; for that reason, I have decided to take an online class to avoid affecting the learning and teaching ability of teacher as well as classmates. At the beginning of the first lesson of the 3rd week, I was very excited when I saw the lesson's agenda in the class because it related to an assignment that my classmates and I had to do. The exercise is a research paper on technologies such as AI, VR&AR, or Cybersecurity. It was exciting that the class was still taugh by Mr. Jonathan as always. But before talking about the research, my classmates and I learned about Cyborgs and Slaughterbots. What impressed me the most was the concept, purpose, and way of working of Slaughterbots. As a result, I have to say that Artificial Intelligence (AI) created by humans is amazing. In addition, the most important part to me is the research paper that we will have to do later. After the lesson that day, I learned more about how to distinguish and apply induction and deduction. Besides, I also learned more about Ethics in doing research.</p>                         
                        <p>On the negative side, I struggled for hours trying to figure out how to absorb that amount of knowledge. Not only did that knowledge help me better understand the subject and assignments, but it also gave me more data to do this second reflection. However, fortunately, a positive thing happened to me when I remembered my friend, Tin. I asked Tin a lot about the lesson on both those days. And as always, he is very welcoming, friendly, and always ready to help me. Thanks to Tin's help, it became easier to summarize and synthesize my lost knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The results of the self-study gave me under a lot of pressure in finding and synthesizing the amount of knowledge that was recorded in the two recordings. Fortunately, I had the help of my friend and in addition to my constant efforts helped me regain the basic knowledge of those lessons. One thing that I also experienced that day was how to endure and deal with the pressures and disadvantages I encountered in studying. That helps me gain more experience to handle that problem for my future study. And it is not lacking when it comes to the fact that I have persistently overcome the problem of losing knowledge in this rather unfavorable situation.</p>

                        <h2 class="subheading"><strong>#3 The third experience in the Online class on TEAMS</strong></h2>
                        
                        <p>In the third week, the class on Thursday of the same week also has a very helpful topic and it related to the assignment what we will have to do, which is the presentation. Although the teacher in class that day was Mr. Peter, I still can absorb the amount of knowledge that Peter imparted because he teaches quite easily. The knowledge of this session is important to me because its content includes learning about audience levels, how to analyze and organize a presentation, and describe an overview of trends through the line charts and column charts.</p>
                        <p>My experience in week 3 was more positive than negative. The positive thing is that I have been provided with the knowledge base to be able to build the exercise more firmly. The negative point of the lessons in this 3rd week is that I did not have the opportunity to interact and discuss with my classmates because I had to attend the online class through the TEAMS app. As a result, I have not been able to share as well as listen to the opinions and thoughts of my classmates clearly to have a broader view of the experiences of my classmates.</p>
                        <p>One more reason that I think my experience of this 3rd week was a positivity; although the fact that I can't interact directly with my classmates because I have to attend online classes, I don't feel like I have to encounter any obstacles. Moreover, I also received a lot of help from my classmates, especially Tin. He helped me create slides for my presentation. Our teamwork had prepared for this presentation was pretty good because we all divided the work equally. For example, I arranged and designed our presentation, and Tin was in charge of proofreading the presentation and creating the scripts.</p>
                        <h2 class="subheading"><strong>#4 The Final Experience and general feelings about the whole course.</strong></h2>
                        <p>Last Monday is also the last learning session for me and my classmates with Mr. Jonathan about Intro to Science and Technology. The topic of this lesson is Computer & Network Security. First, in detail in this lesson, I learned about Caesar Cipher and how to decrypt Caesar Cipher. Besides, I also learned more about Cryptanalysis II and some facts about it. This lesson brings me closer to this simplest and most common type of coding technique. From there, I got a certain foundation to visualize coding languages. Next, I learned the definition of two types of malware as well as ransomware. Furthermore, I also know the consequences that this malicious software will cause during the process of them entering the system. In particular, the concept of the Zero Days I knew before, but I still listened attentively to the lecture to absorb more knowledge and better understand it. The bottom line of this lesson is that I learned more about a chain of defense and destruction of cyber attacks, called Cyber ​​Kill chain.</p>
                        <p>The reason I said last Monday was the last learning session for me and my classmates, even though next Thursday is the last day. That's because we won't be learning anything new this Thursday, and the entire time of this session was spent in groups performed their presentations; this is also the last assignment before I finish this course.</p>
                        <p>To be more specific, I will talk about how I felt about this last week. Although it was the last week of the course, I still felt that the Intro to Science and Technology curriculum was still effective and useful for me until now at least. As for my entire experience of this course, the caption that I wrote for this blog is "Intro to Science and Technology is very active!". I find the course syllabus of this course extremely useful because from the very beginning, this course has given me the most general concepts about the entire ecosystem of the information technology industry. Since then, I start learning more about the introductory knowledge. It's subtle that this course ends with a topic on Network Security, as this topic has told me more about the part of encryption and the potential danger that comes from malware so that I was able to equip myself with certain precautions in the future.</p>
                        <h1 class="subheading"><strong>ACTION PLAN</strong></h1>
                        <h2 class="subheading">Overview of experience and future plans.</h2>
                        <p>Overview of all my experiences and feelings when participating in the Intro to Science and Technology class at RMIT University Saigon South branch, I was able to equip myself with more knowledge about the information technology industry. Besides, I also have cultivated my soft and hard skills during my study and experience in this international environment. The hard skills are general knowledge of the ecosystem of the IT industry as well as the bachelor of IT and Engineering program. About my homework and teamwork skills, I also improved a lot thanks to the fact that I tried to be more open with my classmates and while working in groups with my partner, Tin. For example, I have gained more experience in synthesizing necessary information for myself in the process of studying and training. In addition, my ability to manage, organize and lead groups has also improved a lot. As for my soft skills, I have also improved. For example, I have learned lessons about concentration when working, thoroughness when reviewing and learning about the requirements of the assignment topic. Along with that is how to be patient and endure the pressure that comes from the results of adverse situations in the process of studying and training in this course. I also realized some of my weaknesses, such as not knowing how to manage my time and the amount of my work in the most through way. That led to a few consequences that I couldn't fix in time. However, I have realized that and have the most effective way to handle the above problem. For example, I'll keep a close eye on assignments' deadlines. Then, I'll set a goal for myself to start working on assignments at least two weeks before the due date and submit assignments before the deadline is one week. The first reason is because I will have time to study and focus on handling the following lessons and assignments. The second is that I will have ample time to correct the shortcomings of the work I have completed so that I can submit it on time. I think it's a pretty effective learning strategy for inattentive and forgetful people like me.</p>
                        <p>When I arrive at the Bachelor of Information Technology programs I won't let myself make the same mistakes in the past. In the worst case, I can still handle those difficulties effectively and as thoroughly as possible. Because I really believe and hope in myself to graduate and become an excellent IT professional.</p>
